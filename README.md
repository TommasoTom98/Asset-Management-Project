**Asset Management project** from Post-Graduate Master in Quantitative Finance (Milan Polytechnic, 2024 / 2025)

I took care of **Markowitz Theory** section, specifically points **2** - **3** - **4** described below.


**Requests**:

**1.** Provide a brief description of each of the stock included in your dataset (maximum 2 lines per stock). E.g., sector, company structure, and balance sheet data (use 
       information available online).

**2.** Estimate historical mean and variance covariance matrix of the stocks in your dataset with the methods described below. Estimate the variance covariance matrix with a 
       Shrinkage toward Constant Correlation Approach (consider k=0.35). Estimate the vector of averages with an exponential average (lambda=0.02). Comment on the 
       correlations among the stocks observed in your dataset.

**3.** Plot the efficient portfolio frontier (in the standard deviation-mean space) with a risk-free asset (with annual return Rf=0.03). Comment on the obtained tangent 
       portfolio (or risky asset portfolio).

**4.** Plot the efficient portfolio frontier (in the standard deviation-mean space) with the same risky and risk-free assets but imposing two different constraints:
*  the sum of portfolios weights of the first and second stock in your dataset is equal to 50%.
*  the portfolio weights are above 10% for each stocks.

Comment on the differences on the frontier portfolio with 0.5% monthly expected return with and without the two constraints (you should consider three different 
rontiers: no constraint, constraint 1 and constraint 2).

**5.** Estimate CAPM alpha and beta for your stocks, use the returns of the S&P 500 (you should obtain returns from S&P 500 prices) as proxy for the market returns. Comment 
       on the results, which of the stocks has generated alpha in the previous years? Assume Rf=0.02.

**6.** Compute market implicit returns Î  in a Black Litterman framework and compute the market portfolio (assuming that the market comprises only of your 6 stocks).

**7.** Formulate at least two Black Litterman views for the returns of the stocks in your portfolio for January 2025 (for formulating the views you can use historical 
       averages, news and or public balance sheet data). Comment on the Black Litterman portfolio obtained when considering your views.

**8.** Design a similar way to incorporate the views based on the tracking error variance frontier.
